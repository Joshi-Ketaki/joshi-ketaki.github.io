title: "Access Guided Eviction for GPU Memory"
excerpt: "<img src='/images/Memory_Placement_Access_GE.png'> 
Computer systems are becoming increasingly heterogeneous. In heterogeneous systems, accelerators such as GPUs have lower memory capacity but higher bandwidth than CPUs. 
Furthermore, the interconnects between these devices are slower, slowing down memory transfer. To reduce these slow memory transfers, it is important to keep the data close 
to the node where it will be required."

We looked at the quantity and quality of evictions, i.e. what was evicted and if they were bad eviction candidates.  
A bad eviction candidate is one which will be needed soon and must be brought back after eviction. This causes more evictions because we need to make room for 
the recently discarded data to be brought back in. We saw that the current eviction policy chose a lot of bad candidates for irregular access patterns, which resulted 
in an increase in the number of evictions. The current policy in the CPU-GPU memory management stack was developed when GPUs were predominantly used for applications with streaming access patterns. As a result, the current eviction policy performs poorly in emerging GPU applications such as graph processing, where access patterns are irregular or non-streaming. As part of this internship, I worked on developing an eviction policy that is appropriate for all access patterns. 
This policy is access-aware and does not discard data that will be needed in the near future. This new policy resulted in a two-order-of-magnitude increase in performance. 
It evicts data that will not be used in the near future. This reduces the total number of evictions and, as a result, the number of memory transfers. 
The graph above shows the reduction in evictions as a result of the proposed policy compared to the existing baseline (shown in red).
