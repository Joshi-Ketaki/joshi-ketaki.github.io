Memory prefetching improves performance across many systems layers. However, achieving high prefetch accuracy with low overhead 
is challenging, as memory hierarchies and application memory access patterns become more complicated.  
Recent work has demonstrated the use of deep learning techniques to improve prefetching accuracy, albeit with impractical 
compute and storage overheads. This paper suggests taking inspiration from the learning mechanisms and memory architecture 
of the human brain---specifically, the hippocampus and neocortex---to build resource-efficient, accurate, and adaptable prefetchers.
