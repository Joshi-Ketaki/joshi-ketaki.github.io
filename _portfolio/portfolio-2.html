Prefetching memory accesses improves performance across many system layers. However, as memory hierarchies and application memory 
access patterns become more complicated, achieving high prefetch accuracy with low storage and compute overhead becomes more difficult.  
Recent research has shown that deep learning techniques can be used to improve prefetching accuracy, although with huge compute and 
storage overheads. This work proposes drawing inspiration from the human cognitive mechanism and memory architecture, specifically the hippocampus and neocortex (known as Complementary Learning System(CLS)), to create 
resource-efficient, accurate, and adaptable prefetchers.


We investigate the overheads of deep-learning based prefetchers. We find that existing learning-based prefetchers have high storage 
and compute overheads and operate primarily offline. Even if we solve the offline learning challenge by using online learning, we still 
face the fundamental challenge of catastrophic forgetting, which all online learning models face. We also discuss how CLS principles such 
as replay can be used to reduce catastrophic forgetting while techniques like hebbian learning can be used to reduce compute overheads.
We outline the challenges involved in implementing these CLS-inspired techniques in real-world systems.
