Catastrophic Forgetting is a fundamental challenge faced by all systems that learn online. We propose leveraging cognitive inspiration of context-dependent learning to reduce forgetting. In this work, we demonstrate a catastrophic forgetting mitigation tactic that uses existing neural network architecture as-is. Compared to existing catastrophic forgetting mitigation tactics, our technique takes less storage and is less time-consuming.
