With growing heterogeneity, programmability without compromising performance is of utmost importance. This was research in investigating avenues to offload work on the underlying hardware - be it CPU or any accelerator - without making any changes to the application source code. i.e. An applcation written traditionally for an accelerator such as GPU in a specific language such as CUDA should be able to execute on a CPU if the data offload costs are not worth offloading an application from CPU to the accelerator without making any changes to the application source code to ease programmability while guaranteeing performance.
