This was an end of internship talk. Over the summer, I had investigated enabling execution of an unmodified CUDA source application on CPU SIMD units as well as on the GPU. This meant that if GPU kernel offload costs were higher than the computation time then it made no sense to migrate tasks to the GPU. They could be offloaded to CPU SIMD units themselves if they were available. I developed this in the system software layer as a driver shim transparent to the application developer. We showed performance enhancements of 1.5X compared to an only-CPU SIMD execution and 1.3X better than an only-GPU execution of data center workloads.
