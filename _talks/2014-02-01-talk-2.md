This an invited talk under the ACM-W chapter of Cummins College of Engineering, University of Pune. 
The talk focussed on the developed tool which is a compiler optimizer generator. Given data flow analyses equations, optimization passes such as "Liveness Analysis", "Constant Propogation and Folding", "Available Expression Analysis", "Anticipable Expression Analysis" and "Live Pointer Analysis" are generated and inserted in the compiler on the go. The framework also allowed users to provide their own data flow analyses equations and create custom optimization passes.
