Depending on the application, the nature of the optimization passes within the compiler varies. We developed a compiler optimization generator, which enables compiler researchers and engineers to specify data flow equations for the required optimization. The optimization generator uses these equations to build the desired compiler optimization passes, which it then inserts on the fly into the compiler. This was an invited talk under the ACM-W chapter of Cummins College of Engineering, University of Pune.
