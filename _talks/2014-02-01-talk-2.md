This was the end of thesis talk after the undergraduate research work. The project created an optimizer generated which generated data flow analyses based compiler optimization passes such as "Liveness Analysis", "Constant Propogation and Folding", "Available Expression Analysis", "Anticipable Expression Analysis" and "Live Pointer Analysis" and inserted them in the compiler on the go. The framework also allowed users to provide their own data flow analyses equations and create custom optimization passes.
