I was again incharge of the compiler segment for this course. For this distribution I created and deployed an end-to-end toy compiler. We included introduction to the complete compiler flow focussing on the backend. The students had to implement three optimization passes (peephole, local and intra procedural) and code generation for a restrictive toy ISA that I came up with. The intention was to get students to write optimization passes and generate assembly to understand writing of assembly code apart from learning compilers.
