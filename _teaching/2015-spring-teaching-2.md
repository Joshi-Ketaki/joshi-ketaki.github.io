Responsible for the compiler module. In C, I wrote an end-to-end toy compiler with a restricted ISA:
  1. Introduces students to the entire compiler flow with a focus on the backend.
  2. The students were required to perform three optimization passes (peephole, local, and intra-procedure). The goal was to give students a general overview of compiler optimizations.
  3. The students also had to implement code generation for the given ISA. The goal of this activity was to teach students assembly generation so that they could write assembly code.
  4. Proctored and graded exams.
