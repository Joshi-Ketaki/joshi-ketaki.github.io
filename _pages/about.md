I am a computer science researcher and engineer by profession. 

I have completed my graduate degrees (Masters and M.Phil) in Computer Science research with a focus on Operating Systems and Architecture from [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). 
I received my undergraduate degree (Bachelors) in Computer Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). I completed my undergraduate thesis research in compiler optimizations at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).

Apart from work, I volunteer at a cattle shelter dedicated to saving an Indian species of cow known as the "Gir" cow. Very interestingly this Indian breed has made its right upto South and North Americas and has sustained being cross-bred. [photos to come].
I enjoy cycling and hiking. My recent cycling expedition took me on a ride of 38 miles one-way. [photos to come].
