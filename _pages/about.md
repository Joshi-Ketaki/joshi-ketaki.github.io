I am on the job-market for full-time opportunities! Reach out to me at ketaki.joshi@yale.edu(mailto:ketaki.joshi@yale.edu)!

I am also a post candidacy researcher at Yale University.

My research has been on improving the efficacy of memory management in tiered memory systems. Specifically, I have worked on improving prefetching and eviction in CPU-GPU memory systems.

I have proposed the use of practical machine learning solutions to build adaptable, accurate, and resource-efficient memory management solutions. While developing these solutions, I am making use of cognitive principles to solve fundamental issues in online machine learning such as catastrophic forgetting.


I have earned my Masters in Computer Science (Thesis) and M.Phil with Computer Science(Thesis) from Yale. 
Before Yale, I worked full-time at Nvidia's compiler optimization group. 
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). I completed my undergraduate thesis research in compiler optimizations at 
the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Uday Khedkar](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/).
