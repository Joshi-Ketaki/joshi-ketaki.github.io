I am a fifth year PhD candidate from Yale University advised by Prof. Abhishek Bhattacharjee. 
My research is inspired by cognitive principles for performance improvement in virtual memory management system. Specifically, I am revisiting memory access prefetching as a continual learning task typically seen in datacenters. My research aims at improving the use of machine learning for prefetching. This looks at the fundamnetal challeneges such as catastrophic forgetting which limits the application of machine learning techniques for memeory management.

Before Yale, I was part of the compiler optimization group at NVIDIA. I completed my undergraduate from University of Pune, India and wrote my undergraduate thesis at Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai where I was advised by Prof. Uday Khedkar.

I originally hail from Pune also known as 'The Oxford of the East'- a city in western India surrounded by hills and home to many educational institutes. Apart from work, I enjoy swimming and cycling a lot. While indoors, I love experimenting with different spice profiles for tea.
