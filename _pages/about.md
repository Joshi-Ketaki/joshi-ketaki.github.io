[WEBSITE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION]

I am a doctoral candidate at Yale University, where I am advised by [Prof. Abhishek Bhattacharjee.](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/). 

My research leverages cognitive principles to enable practical Machine Learning (ML) solutions to build resource-efficient computer systems. I am specifically interested in making ML solutions practical in terms of storage and latency for virtual memory management.

Before Yale, I worked at NVIDIA in the compiler optimization group. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). I completed my undergraduate thesis research in compiler optimizations at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where [Prof. Uday Khedkar](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/) advised me.

I am originally from [Pune, India](https://pune.gov.in/), commonly known as 'The Oxford of the East,' which is a city in western India surrounded by hills and home to numerous educational institutes. 
I enjoy swimming and cycling. While I'm at home, I enjoy experimenting with different spice profiles for tea.
