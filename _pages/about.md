I am a doctoral candidate at Yale University, where I am advised by [Prof. Abhishek Bhattacharjee.](https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/)

My research predominantly has been on improving the efficacy of virtual memory management optimizations i.e. prefetching and evictions.
I have proposed the use of practical machine learning solutions to build adaptable, accurate, and resource-efficient memory management solutions. In developing these accurate and resource-efficient machine-learning solutions, I am also exploring cognitive principles to solve fundamental issues in machine learning such as catastrophic forgetting.


Before Yale, I was a part of Nvidia's compiler optimization group. 
I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Pune](http://www.unipune.ac.in/). I completed my undergraduate thesis research in compiler optimizations at 
the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I was advised by [Prof. Uday Khedkar](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/).

I am originally from [Pune, India](https://pune.gov.in/), commonly known as 'The Oxford of the East'. It is a city in western India surrounded by hills and home to numerous educational institutes. 
I enjoy swimming and cycling. While I'm at home, I enjoy experimenting with different spice profiles for tea.
